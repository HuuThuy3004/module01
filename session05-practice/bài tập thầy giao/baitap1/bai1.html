    <div class="content content2">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage</div>
    <div class="content content3">With CSS, you can control the color , font , the size of text , the spacing between elements , how elements are positioned and laid out , what background images or background colors are to be used , different displays for different devices and screen sizes , and much more!</div>
    <div class="content content4">
        <b>Tip:</b> the word <b>cascading</b> means 
        that a style applied to a parent 
        element will also apply to all children 
        elements within the parent. 
        So if you set the color of the 
        body text to "blue" , all headings , paragraphs , and 
        other text elements within the body will 
        also get the same color (unless you specify somthing else)!
